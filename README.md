# discord-proxy
Node.js app that runs a Discord.js bot 

## But how he do dat doe?
This app uses discord.js to fetch the last 50 messages and output it via html. The app also runs an index.html file that contains formatting for each message and each message gets parsed and configured so it displays nicely.

## Someone is abusing this!
I am in no control of the abuse as this uses no discord authorization in order to keep the proxy part. In the future this may change with ip banning.

## Can I contribute?
Yes! All contributions will help and I am very open to fixing issues and accepting new features.
